JPA-Ex27-CriteriaQueries

Demonstrates how to use the JPA Meta Model and criteria queries.

Take a look at:
* dk.lundogbendsen.client.StandaloneJpaClient to see how the criteria api is used (search for 'CriteriaBuilder')
* pom.xml which includes dependencies for the meta model generator.
* Folder target/generated-sources/annotations to see the source code for the meta model.

How to run:
1. mvn install (or use the IntelliJ Maven tab (to the right)).
2. Run as Java application: dk/lundogbendsen/client/StandaloneJpaClient.java
